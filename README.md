-- Overview	
	All needs will increase at a rate of 10% every 
	tick. To take care of your pet, you will need 
	to make sure that its needs are met. If its 
	hunger or thirst reach 100%, it will get sick.
	If it spends too long sick, it will die and 
	you will need to start over. Whenever you do 
	something with your pet, that need won't go 
	down with that tick.
	
-- Hunger
	If you feed your pet, then you will decrease 
	its hunger by 50% and increase its thirst and 
	waste by 20% plus the standard 10% per tick.
	
-- Thirst
	If you water your pet then you will decrease 
	its	thirst by 50% and increase its waste by 20%
	plus the standard 10% per tick.
	
-- Boredom
	Have fun with your pet! Playing with you pet 
	will decrease its boredom by 30%. If your pet 
	gets too bored then it will only want sleep.
	
-- Waste
	If you let waste reach 100%, your pet will make
	a mess. Every mess increases the chance that 
	your pet will get sick. You will have to spend 
	a turn cleaning up each mess, one by one if it 
	comes to that. On the plus side, it will reduce
	the waste need by 50%. You can get ahead of that
	making sure that they can relieve themselves in 
	a safe way.

-- Tiredness
	Your pet will get tired and need to sleep. If 
	tiredness is 100%, it will sleep no matter what
	choice you make. Either way it falls asleep, it
	will decrease its tiredness by 100% after 
	sleeping.
