-- Overview	
	All needs will increase at a rate of 10% every 
	tick. To take care of your pet, you will need 
	to make sure that its needs are met. If its 
	hunger or thirst reach 100%, it will get sick.
	If it spends too long sick, it will die and 
	you will need to start over. Whenever you do 
	something with your pet, that need won't go 
	down with that tick.
	
-- Hunger
	If you feed your pet, then you will decrease 
	its hunger by 50% and increase its thirst and 
	waste by 20% plus the standard 10% per tick.
	
-- Thirst
	If you water your pet then you will decrease 
	its	thirst by 50% and increase its waste by 20%
	plus the standard 10% per tick.
	
-- Waste
	If you let waste reach 100%, your pet will make
	a mess. Every mess increases the chance that 
	your pet will get sick. You will have to spend 
	a turn cleaning up each mess, one by one if it 
	comes to that. On the plus side, it will reduce
	the waste need by 50%. You can get ahead of that
	making sure that they can relieve themselves in 
	a safe way.
	
-- Sickness
	if your pet is sick, you will need to take it to 
	the vet. If 5 ticks pass while being sick, your 
	pet will die. After going to the vet, your pet 
	will get less enjoyment of playing with your for
	10 more ticks.
